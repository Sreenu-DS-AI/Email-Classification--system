# üìß Real-Time Email Classification and Spam Detection using NLP

An intelligent system that classifies incoming emails as **spam** or **ham (not spam)** in real-time using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Machine Learning**. This project demonstrates how to preprocess text data, train classification models, and deploy them for real-time prediction.
